# Windows Log Management System

A comprehensive Windows process monitoring and logging system.

## Project Overview

The Windows Log Management System is a C++ application that provides:
- Process monitoring and logging
- Circular buffer for log storage
- Trie-based log search functionality
- Real-time process tracking

## Features

- Real-time process monitoring
- Circular buffer for efficient log storage
- Trie-based search index for fast log retrieval
- Severity-based log classification
- Process activity tracking
- Log file management
- Interactive command-line interface
- Color-coded output for better readability

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- Windows SDK

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd windows-log-management-system
```

2. Compile the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o log_manager
```

## Usage

### Running the Program
```bash
./log_manager
```

### Main Menu Options
1. Start Log Capture
   - View running processes
   - Select PID to monitor
   - Begin logging process activity

2. Stop Log Capture

   - Display log file locations

4. Analyze Logs
   - View detailed log analysis
   - Search through logs
   - Filter by severity
   - View statistics

5. Show Running Processes
   - List all active processes
   - Display PIDs and process names

6. View Recent Logs
   - Display latest log entries
   - Monitor current activity

7. Exit
   - Safely terminate the program

## Log Analysis Commands

When analyzing logs, the following commands are available:
- `!!errors` - Show all error messages
- `!!warnings` - Show all warning messages
- `!!stats` - Show log statistics
- `!!timeline` - Show chronological event timeline
- `!!search <query>` - Search log content
